HoloBan
=======
Bukkit plugin that prevents armor stands with additional NBT data from being spawned and placed in Creative mode. Fixes
the armor stand "hologram" exploit described [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/player-created-holograms-new-exploit-1-10-2.190846/).

Uses CraftBukkit/NMS, so this currently only works on Bukkit/Spigot 1.10 and 1.10.2 servers.
