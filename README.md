HoloBan
=======
Bukkit plugin that prevents armor stands with additional NBT data from being spawned and placed in Creative mode. Fixes
the armor stand "hologram" exploit described [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/player-created-holograms-new-exploit-1-10-2.190846/).

Uses CraftBukkit/NMS, so this must be updated for each version of Minecraft.

 - For Spigot 1.10 / 1.10.2, use version [0.1](https://github.com/Dumbo52/HoloBan/releases/tag/v0.1)
 - For Spigot 1.11, use version [0.2](https://github.com/Dumbo52/HoloBan/releases/tag/v0.2)
